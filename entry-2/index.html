        <h1> Funk</h1>
        
        <h6> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>
        <h5> "Funky" redirects here. For other uses, see Funk (disambiguation). Not to be confused with phonk.
            For technical reasons, "Funk #49" redirects here. For the song, see Funk 49.
            </h5>

        <h1> Etymology</h1>
        <h5> The word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin</h5>
        <h5> fumigare (which means "to smoke") via Old French fungiere and, in this sense, it was first</h5>
        <h5> documented in English in 1620. In 1784, funky meaning "musty" was first documented, which, in</h5>
        <h5> turn, led to a sense of "earthy" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something "deeply or strongly felt".[9][10] Even</h5>    
        <h5> though in white culture, the term funk can have negative connotations of odor or being in a bad mood (in a funk), in African</h5>
        <h5> communities, the term funk, while still linked to body odor, had the positive sense that a musician's hard-working, honest effort led to</h5>
        <h5> sweat, and from their "physical exertion" came an "exquisite" and "superlative" performance.[11]</h5>

        <h1> Characteristics</h1>
        <h4> Rhythm and tempo</h4>
        <h5> Like soul, funk is based on dance music, so it has a strong "rhythmic role".[17] The sound of funk is as much based on the "spaces between the notes" as the notes that are played; as such, rests between notes are important.[18] While there are rhythmic similarities between funk and disco, funk has a "central dance beat that's slower, sexier and more syncopated than disco", and funk rhythm section musicians add more "subtextures", complexity and "personality" onto the main beat than a programmed synth-based disco ensemble.[19]</h5>
