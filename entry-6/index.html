<h1>Country Music</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Country (also called country and western) is a music genre originating in the southern regions of the United States, both the American South and the Southwest. First produced in the 1920s, country music primarily focuses on singing stories about working-class and blue-collar American life.</p>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (e.g., "honky-tonk music") with simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments like banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and various types of guitars (acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator). While rooted in American folk traditions like old-time and Appalachian music, influences from Mexican, Irish, Hawaiian, and blues music have also shaped the genre.</p>

<h2>Evolution of the Genre</h2>
<p>Originally known as "hillbilly music," the term "country music" gained popularity in the 1940s and later encompassed western music. Modern styles include Texas country, red dirt, and Tejano, which continue to exist alongside traditional genres. In 2009, country music was the most-listened-to radio genre during evening commutes in the U.S.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>The components of modern country music date back to music traditions throughout the Southern and Southwestern United States, establishing its place in American popular music in the 1920s. According to country historian Bill C. Malone, country music was "introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon."</p>

<p>Folk music and instruments from Europe and the Mediterranean migrated into the southern Appalachian Mountains over nearly 300 years, developing into Appalachian music. Westward expansion brought about Cajun music near the Mississippi River, and in the Southwest, influences from Native American, Mexican, and cowboy ballads gave rise to New Mexico music and the evolution of western music. The steel guitar, prominent in country music, traces its roots to Hawaiian music.</p>
