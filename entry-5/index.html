        <h1> Pop Music</h1>

        <h5> In the 1940s, improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style and, ten or twenty years later,
        </h5>
        <h5> inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles "revolutionized the manner in which pop has been
        </h5>
        <h5> disseminated", which helped to move pop music to "a record/radio/film star system".[34] Another technological change
        </h5>
        <h5> was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances, which meant that "pop stars had
        </h5>
        <h5> to have a visual presence".[34] In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable transistor radios meant that</h5>
        <h5> teenagers in the developed world could listen to music outside of the home.[34] By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop</h5>
        <h5> music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which "favoured those artists such as</h5>
        <h5> Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal".[34]</h5>
